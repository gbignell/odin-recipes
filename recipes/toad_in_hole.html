    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>115g/4oz plain flour</li>
      <li>large pinch of salt</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
      <li>300ml/Â½ pint milk</li>
      <li>2 tbsp/30g fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>8 good quality pork, beef or vegetarian sausages</li>
      <li>2 tbsp/30g Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>
        2 tbsp/30g of beef dripping or white vegetable fat for vegetarians
      </li>
      <li>knob of butter, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the batter, sift the flour into a large bowl. Add the salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a well in the centre of the flour and crack in the eggs. Using a
        wooden spoon, gradually beat the eggs into the flour then slowly beat in
        the milk until the batter is the consistency of double cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain and push any remaining lumps through a sieve. Stir in the thyme.
        Cover and leave to stand for 30 minutes, or ideally 3-4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a large non-stick pan and cook the sausages over a medium heat
        until golden-brown all over. (If you do not have a non-stick pan add a
        little oil.) Turn off the heat and brush the sausages with the mustard.
        Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dripping or white vegetable fat into an ovenproof dish and
        heat in the oven for five minutes or until the dripping is hot and hazy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sausages to the hot dish and pour in the batter. Immediately
        return the dish to the oven and cook for 35-40 minutes until well-risen
        and golden-brown.
      </li>
      <li>Serve seasoned with black pepper and a large knob of butter.</li>
